Linux setup script for most distros
The initial setup will be in bash, and then eventually in pythong (with a GUI)

So far what works is the ability to install needed programs and some programs from source (ex: google chrome)

next steps:
Give users a choice based on which linux OS they are running - Debian, RedHat, Arch based
 [I need to make sure that each choice is tied to an appropriate function in the program]
After this, ensure full functionality on debian based linux then move to a different linux


verify functionality on a non debian based linux as this was script was written on a ubuntu box.


Basic Features
Installaton of various linux software
Ability to run on various linux distros (via choice from a menu)


Future updates
A python GUI?
Re-rewritten in python
Functions that can add a custom design to the UI based on the DE being used
Customizations based on the type of use for the linux box (web dev setup, security setup, etc...)
